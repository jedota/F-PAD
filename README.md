# Flickr-PAD: New Face High-Resolution Presentation Attack Detection Database
# Description
In order to increase the diversity of image quality, this work presents a new PAD database based on open-access Flickr images called: "Flickr-PAD". Our new hand-made database shows high-quality printed and screen scenarios. This will help researchers to compare new approaches to existing algorithms on a wider database. This database will be available for other researchers. A leave-one-out protocol was used to train and evaluate three PAD models based on MobileNet-V3 (small and large) and EfficientNet-B0. The best result was reached with MobileNet-V3 large with BPCER10 of 7.08\% and BPCER20 of 11.15\%.
